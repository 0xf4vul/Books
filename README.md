Books
=====

This project maintains a list of the books that I am reading sorted by priority. The concept is simple: I don't get distracted by various options because I read the books in the exact order on this list. If I wish to adjust which book I read in which order, then I must change this list.

## Reading Process

The process for reading these books is to mark the book while reading quickly, either via dogear, notes, or digital analogs to those, and then capturing key concepts on my /concepts page on the site.

This will crystallize and archive the key points and concepts I got out of the texts. If you don't capture what you learned in an organized way, you basically wasted that time.

There should be an optimal way you live each day, and any information you take in should either affect that system or not. If it does not, then it wasn't useful. If it did, this should be reflected in a tangible way in your daily schedule.
